# ClassRosterCompare
Personal Java program to compare 3 class rosters and find which students are in all 3 classes.
Uses ArrayLists and File I/O processes to read the roster files, create ArrayLists from the 
data, compare the ArrayLists to each other and find the commonalities.  It prints the resulting
size of the new Lists and the common members.

It then outputs the result of the different commonalities to new txt files:
--1 for students in both Java2 and Systems Analysis,
--1 for students in both Systems Analysis and Javascript,
--1 for students in both Java2 and Javascript,
--and 1 for students in all 3 classes.
